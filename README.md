# calculus-assignment
A project I completed for my high school multivariable calculus course, involving classes and functions for a few mathematical concepts.

## Notes:

(Circa December 2020 and May 2021)  
At the beginning of the course, we were tasked with a number of repetitive calculations for homework assignments. Being as lazy as I was, I wrote a program to perform one of the particularly lengthy ones automatically. At the end of the course, we had a final project that required some creativity to be interwoven with the concepts we had learned. I figured a fun and useful thing to do would be to convert some of the appropriate concepts into classes.
